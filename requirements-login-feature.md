# Requirements for the Login Feature

These requirements were created to serve as examples. Each requirement specifies functionalities and behaviors that a login feature must fulfill. Based on these requirements, the test cases can be developed to validate the UI layout, input field behavior, error handling, and authentication processes, ensuring the system functions as intended.

### UI Requirements:

**Page Layout**

- The page must have a logo displayed on the left side.
- A Login form must be centered on the page.
